Education is one of the most important human rights. It serves as a capital investment and equalizer for everyone. The right to education is practiced starting from the formative years of a child all throughout their life. However, not all children will have the chance to exercise this opportunity. And this opportunity to avail education should not be as challenged as to whatever mental and physical status they may present in.

Inclusive education also called inclusion is an education that includes everyone. This covers non-disabled and disabled children with special educational needs and to be able to provide them with fair and safe learning environment.

The Philippine Constitution, the Child and Welfare  Code (PD 603), the Enhanced Basic Education Act (RA 105333), and the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons (RA 7277) mandated the adoption of IE (Inclusive Education) approach in the Philippine Education system.

We consolidated seven source data from the Department of Education. Then proceeded to cleaning the datasets including dropping the zero and missing values. To produce a certain result, we concatenated and merged some chosen datasets and filtered it to our target study.
In getting a good grip of our raw data for us to show an accurate model, we engineered 5 features in answering our target study about SPED. Ratios exclusive only to SPED (such as the student-teacher ratio, student per school room ratio, and MOOE per teacher ratio, MOOE per student ratio, and MOOE per room ratio). We then proceeded to prepare the dataset and scaled it to feed to our different models.
