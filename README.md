# Resource Allocation of SPED Schools in the Philippines

A data science project made by Data Science Fellows Cohort 7 in Eskwelabs

We studied on the Resource Allocation of SPED Schools in the Philippines. 

Our study sought out to look into the data of Department of Education. 

Majority of schools are located in more developed areas which are urban and partially urban. It implies that SPED facilities are least accessible to rural and far flung places.

As for the location of SPED schools per province, most are located in Luzon, with concentrations as well in Western and Central Visayas, and some parts of Mindanao. The Top 5 provinces with most SPED schools are at NCR, Pangasinan, Batangas, Zamboanga del Sur, Quezon.

Despite having more MOOE allocation than non SPED schools, there is an uneven distribution of resources for SPED. In particular, majority of SPED schools suffer from lack of resources while the minority has the most allocated resources.
